To-Do List App (React)

A fully functional To-Do List application built with React, demonstrating core front-end development concepts such as:

- State Management with Context API for efficient handling of application state across components.
- React Router for seamless navigation between different views within the app.
- Array Methods (such as map, filter, reduce) to dynamically render and manipulate task lists.
- Hooks like useReducer, useState for managing component-level state and useEffect for handling side effects.
- Debounce Technique implemented in the search functionality to optimize performance by limiting the
  frequency of API calls or filtering operations.
  This project showcases my ability to build scalable, user-friendly applications with React, applying modern development techniques and best practices.
